# KonectIQ v1

**Unified Network, Security, and Backup Management for Multi-Cloud SMEs**

---

## Overview

KonectIQ is a lightweight, modular control platform designed for Managed Service Providers (MSPs), independent consultants, and small IT teams operating in resource-constrained environments. It consolidates network management, security enforcement, and backup operations into a single control plane—eliminating tool sprawl and reducing manual overhead.

**Built for:** Reliability. Clarity. Operational efficiency.

---

## Why KonectIQ?

Small operators face three recurring challenges:

1. **Fragmented tooling** – Juggling separate systems for network, security, and backup
2. **Manual processes** – Operations that don't scale with limited staff
3. **Overbuilt platforms** – Enterprise solutions that are too complex, expensive, or resource-intensive

KonectIQ provides one unified interface to manage, secure, and monitor distributed environments—without the enterprise bloat.

## Design Principles

- **Modular by design** – Deploy only what you need
- **Automation-first** – Reduce repetitive manual work
- **Low overhead** – Runs on modest cloud or edge infrastructure
- **Cost-conscious** – Built for budget-aware teams
- **Operator-focused** – Designed for production use, not demos

---

## Modules (v1)

KonectIQ v1 includes the following core modules:

| Module | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **CommandView™** | Central management and orchestration |
| **Pulse™** | Minimal dashboard for critical status and alerts |
| **SecureMesh™** | Network segmentation and access control |
| **Shield™** | Endpoint security and threat response |
| **Vault™** | Backup and recovery management |
| **DeviceScan™** | Network discovery and asset inventory |
| **EdgeBox™** | Optional on-premises edge node |
| **SkyEdge™** | Cloud edge services |
| **PilotView™** | Read-only client visibility portal |

**Security and backup capabilities** are powered by the **SkyLock Engine™**, which integrates SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) components.
